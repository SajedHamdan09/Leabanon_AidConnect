# Lebanon_AidConnect

This web-based application is designed to streamline aid distribution in Lebanon, aiming to connect centers with individuals in need. The system is built to efficiently manage inventory, facilitate communication between centers and beneficiaries, and enhance coordination during humanitarian crises. It is anticipated that the project will improve the overall effectiveness of relief efforts through automated processes, real-time data, and user-friendly interfaces.

Admins will have comprehensive control over center operations, including inventory/stock tracking and the approval or decline of aid requests. The system implements secure two-factor authentication (2FA) to ensure the safety of admin accounts. Beneficiaries can register to submit aid requests and track their application status securely.

Admins will be able to create and update center profiles and manage the database of families in need. Inventory management includes real-time tracking of stock levels with automated notifications when supplies run low.

The system allows admins to announce important updates regarding aid availability and distribution schedules. It also includes a messaging feature that enables direct communication between beneficiaries and admins. A chatbot is available to provide real-time assistance to users.

Beneficiaries can easily search for nearby aid centers by location or the type of goods/services available through an advanced search feature. The system integrates map services to help users locate centers with ease.

The system provides detailed reports on distributed goods, stock levels, and the beneficiaries served, with visual dashboards to support admins in optimizing distribution processes and resource management.
